# 👨‍🚀 Jatin Chaudhary | AI Scientist | Builder of Trustworthy Systems

Hello Visitor 👋,

I’m Jatin, a Scientist from the University of Turku, Finland 🇫🇮  

I build AI systems that don’t just *work*, but *work ethically, explainably, and reliably* in high-stakes environments like **healthcare**, **space biology**, and **finance**.

Whether it’s segmenting tumors, fine-tuning models for new domains, or designing autonomous agents that follow rules *because they don't want to*, I’m all about **making AI real, robust, and responsible**.

## 🛠️ What I Do Best

- 🔬 **Foundation Models**: Vision Transformers, CNNs, attention mechanisms  
- 🧠 **Few-Shot Learning**: Creator of *DAIFT*, a scalable domain-aware fine-tuning method  
- 💹 **Algorithmic Trading**: Built agents with **governance-aware trading logic**  
- 🛰️ **Biomedical AI**: MRI-based cancer detection with explainability and generalization  
- 🛡️ **AI Governance**: Lead architect of **GUARDIAN** framework for safe AI agents  
- 🧰 **Tools I Speak Fluently**: `PyTorch`, `MONAI`, `SQL`, `TensorFlow`, `n8n`, and GenAI tools for building **agentic solutions**

## 🚀 Projects That Define Me

### 🧠 TITAN  
**Tumor-Informed Transformer for Anatomy Navigation**  
A multimodal tumor segmentation model built to be **reproducible, explainable, and generalizable** across BraTS, LiTS, KiTS datasets.

### 🛡️ GUARDIAN  
**Governance Utility Agent for Rule-Driven AI Norms**  
A modular enforcement system that **monitors, verifies, and intervenes** in agent behavior, forming the spine of my submission to *Nature Machine Intelligence*.

### 🧬 DAIFT  
**Domain-Aware Iterative Fine-Tuning**  
A lightweight, scalable fine-tuning strategy that adapts foundation models without losing grip on generalization.

### 🧪 Radiomics Foundation Model  
Multi-center, multi-protocol prostate cancer diagnostic system. Built for robustness, designed for deployment.

### 🔁 Superlevel Set Optimizer  
A mathematically grounded optimizer leveraging **Lyapunov stability** and **geometric superlevel sets** to rethink neural convergence.
